<p>Hey there! Sorry for the lack of format im am super duper new to the world of html well any coding language really .

I am and Australian Indigenous male who is VERY mixed (mainly European) and have finished my cert III and IV in 
Health and Fitness. I am an english speaker but hopefully after completing my studies here i will learn japanese 
and travel overseas to live and work in the industry. One fun fact about me is i work in a prison for young people.
Honestly it is pretty intense but not as crazy as learning PHP for work,Python for intro to programming and HTML 
for Intro to IT!!!!.</p>


<p>My interest in IT are currently abit of a blur in all honesty my needs are somewhat basic. i desire to create a open 
world rpg game that incorperates basic climbing/free roam aspects of games like assassins creed and DCUO. I love exploring
and feeling like a complete badass it fuels that feeling of escaping real life. not only am i intersted in videogames i am 
pretty extrigued by the idea/revolution of the metaverse. it fuels my desire to help create a real life ready player one
themed program. IT in my mind is the creation of life beyond our physical bodies i plan on using IT in my future home.
Using it to make it more accessable and secure making it a freeflowing living space. Forever evoloving, a place where i 
can create freely and feel comfortable and safe.</p>


<p>I just started working at a youth detention centre start of 2022. i asked if they needed help in the IT department.
funnily enough at the time i had no experience with anything IT based. The silly buggers said yes nad have had me 
hooked ever since. i honestly have wanted to do it for the longest time, but have only just realised how addicting it is.

Im franticly learning all of this full time studying buisness about 3-4 days a week as i work Full time 5 daysa week
around 10 hours Per day!!!. Im stressing about life but have never felt so compfy/happy. </p>

<p>By the end of this course i plan on having a better direction in the industry. and some more fundamentals behind 
The wonderful magical world of IT!.</p>


<p>Here is a link for my ideal first job (even as a part timer). </p>

<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56200038?type=standard#sol=ad81c45fe153712e2492603400c4d335552fa5c4">My First Job Link</a>


<p> my current ideal job isn't really my long term dream job. i plan on getting experience in the creative side of IT
as a games developer so i can learn to write code and express myself creatively first. during said time i would mind
developing my own skills towards coding/ possibly becoming a data scientist. it seems like a practicle job 
opportunity for traveling. 

Now for said job i would need experience in different coding languages(That i am currently unaware of) but I know for 
a fact that with time i could achieve this goal by simply focusing on a more coding heavy job. something like a 
computer scientist or even just staying where in my current job at the youth detention centre. they are showing
me how to backend and develop a student data system plus how to develop curriculim via UNITY. </p>

<p>Now for all my test results. i hope you find the result as intriguing as i did.<p>

<p>1. Myers.briggs Test results </p>
<img src="PERSONALITYTEST RESULT.png" alt="Assertive Logician" />
<p>2. Learning style results </p>
<img src="LearningStyle.png" alt="VisualLearner" />
<p>3. Mental wellbeing score (lower then i want it to be at the moment but am working on it</p>
<img src="MentalWellbeingScore.png" alt="16.4 MHQ Score (this is quiet low)" />

<p>To me these reults mean i have a pretty good work ethic and can function pretty well,
on my own or in a team. i am a logician so i will be able to think on the fly and constently
able to supprt my group creatively. </p>

<p>Seeing my results is quiet surprising. It seems i may have let myself go down abit of a rabbit hole
Mental health wise. I am working on that now but i know it wouldnt effect working in a group.
when it comes to work i am a people pleaser i will go %100 at all times. </p>

<p>When forming a team i should choose a diverse range of people but most definetly someone who
can understand mental health issues, so i can actively chat about, mental health based issues.
not personal stuff though but help it to be a open communication between one co worker to another </p>

<p>I have several project ideas! None of which i know anything about how to complete./p>
<p>Idea List;</p>
<p>1.Developing some form of hacking/modding tools to utilise on games Like Fivem (Gtav)<p>
<p>2.Developing a freeroam RPG game using unity<p>
<p>3.Creating a phone app that utilises tower defence/typhoon systems<p>
<p>4.I would also love to create small robots so in the future i can create my dream house<p>

<p>Im very passionate about creating roleplaying/artistic creative enviroments. i would love 
to get into videgame development but also create cool useful gadgets like a automatic shoebox
with touch controls (using feet) i would also love to create a bot that grabs shoes and drives them to
and from my door. Even develop a high tec automatic lock using nfc tags and or a pin
<p>under pressure i cant really choose between small robots or creating a game using unity
So for the sake of this assessment and the lack of access that i have with in person projects (ROBOTS)
ill choose to create addicting game Something to start off with will be basic but utilise an addictive 
feeling, the feeling of freedom and being superpowered i will develop a game that utilises the idea 
of a human who is cursed to be a werewolf a somewhat humanoid one. It will be open world so the player 
can experience a somewhat roleplaying experience of being a monster in disguise. hmm cool concept and name
whats the term Skinwalker? anyways it will be a fun game based on exploration but also brutal and exciting </p>

<p>Currently in the world there is no real werewolf game thats brings the feeling fully to life there have been 
some games that have just barely scratched the surface. like skyrim, the wolf among us and the order. none 
of which really let you be a wolf. however there is a game almost out. called vampire masquerade bloodlines 2 
It isnt a werewolf game but captures the feeling almost perfectly of what it is to be a 'Monster' among 
humans. There is talk in the community that they are recreating a whole bunch of worlds like vampires 
and also in the not near future a werewolf lore. that in time the will incorporate together.
I love the idea of that so in order to show the world what a good wereolf game can be i would love to give
them all of the resources they would ever need ;) </p>

<p>To begin with i would set the game in a semi realistic medieval fantasy world, (think of Medieval dynasty).
It will be a dark world where the nights are endless and the village people fear the slightest sound out of the normal...
a strong gust of wind slamming doors closed, the sound of something running through the puddles outside. the eary
feeling watched. oh but wait oyu are the wereolf right? wrong well kind of not you are whats known as a beta,
someone who cannot yet fully turn but is not yet part of a pack. a somewhat lone wolf. not only are hunters
after you but the werewolves who have lost themselves to the curse completely. There should be a ranking system
implimented where there are different kinds of wolves and humans, some who use silver weapons'hunters' and some 
who weild pitchforks or iron blades'villagers'. the villagers will literally be nothing to you.
well maybe the form of experience you need to hunt in order to grow into a fully formed 'ALPHA' wolf. </p>

<p>It is a first person game with capabilities to be Third person, for when the character feeds or climbs. i want the ability for the character 
to be able to jump and climb the village houses freely.this will be just the beginning of our free roaming aspect.
our character can hide in there own or strangers buildings from hunters or wolves. Because they are a werewolve themselves they know
how to hide their own scent from other wolves, so the hiding function will still be useful against the other
Big Bad WOLVES. Players will be able to feed on the villagers to gain strength and abilities. Just dont
feed to much, the other wolves may be watching...</p>

<p>At the same time i dont want this game to just be a good werewolf game. i would love if it mirrored Medieval dynasty.
In the fact that it is a great Townbuilding, survival and roleplaying game where you can create your own village and 
jobs. this allows the character to be able to chop wood and gather stone for buildings or even farm and fish for food.
Now when our player is in human form can they use weapons? of course they can now there comes a problem
will extremely expensive weapons be better than a wolves claws?... NO but the same goes the other way.
To begin with we will keep everythign around the same damage scale. all weapons and wolf attacks will do the same
They will all inflict some form of damage whether it be bleeding damage or outright INSTADEATH.
It just depends on where you hit... oh and did i mention the wolf powers will include some form of ability to see 
in the night or even the ability to see scent trails. the idea behind a game like this is you need it to still be
simple. Simple and somewhat realistic. wolves can die and humans can die too. you know whats scarier than death.
PERMADEATH!!!. once you die you have to start a new player. someone you may have bitten or even  child you 
may have had?.</p>

<p>Tools we can use for this project include Unity, unreal engine and even game maker studio.
I have never created a game before so this will be a task. I will use my at home PC which should suffice
it utilises a Nvidia 2080 ti Graphics card plus a whole bunch of other goodies. ill script the code
using python (still need to learn) and possibly learn some c++

<p>Feasability wise it will be quiete difficult to manage all of said task with a small team, especially
one with new people like me in it</p>

<p>The outcome and final project would mean that we would successfuly give the gaming community something 
new and fresh to paly with. it would show and hopefully influence the creators of vampire bloodlines 2 
what a werewolf could actually be like. and for people like myself who want to Feel what its like
to be a werewolf. hell people who enjoy roleplaying games could seriously mod this to be a vampire game.
or even just use it a a open word roleplaying survival game and lets them live out there fantasies.</p>
